* Every faction has been given troops to fit their lore, and new factions have been added for a current total of 39 factions and 230 regular troop types (not including mercenary and special units).
* No more upgrading your troops from a peasant to a fully armored knight in a few days.
    * The troops you recruit will not be upgraded as easily.
